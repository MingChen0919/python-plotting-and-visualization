# Matplotlib low level graphic elements

## Figure, Axes and Subplot

* **`Figure`** is a window or a top level container which hosts axes or any other graphic elements.
* **`Axes`** is a plotting area or a coordinate system for plotting. **`Axes`** can not exist without a **`Figure`** instance.
* **`Subplot`** is an **`Axes`** which is already bound to a **`Figure`** instance.
